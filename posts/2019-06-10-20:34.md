# Reading update

## Turn The Ship Around!

Excellent book on management. I ignored this for years out of a mistaken
preconception of American military leadership style, and so I guess my
prolonged ignorance is a fair reward for my prejudice.

## The Age of Surveillance Capitalism

Really long academic book. Maybe the most important book of our time.

I want someone else to read it so I can develop my thoughts better.

## Swordheart

Loads of fun. Turns out I like romance.

## Tiamat's Wrath

I continue to enjoy the Expanse. Daniel Abraham is one of the smartest writers
in the genre.

## Others

* Oh Crap! Potty Training
* Wintersmith
* I Shall Wear Midnight
* The Shepherd's Crown
